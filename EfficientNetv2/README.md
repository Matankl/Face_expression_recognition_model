## About
EfficientFER is a lightweight and efficient emotion recognition model with high accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset. The model can successfully detect 7 basic emotional states (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral) using modern deep learning techniques.

## Performance
- **Accuracy in %:** %82.47 (SOTA on FER-2013)

## Features
- Lightweight and efficient model architecture
- SOTA accuracy

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.5.1
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{username}/EfficientFER.git
cd EfficientFER
```

## Dataset
FER-2013 dataset is a comprehensive dataset consisting of 35,887 images and 7 different emotion classes. The model was trained and tested on this dataset using extra training data.
